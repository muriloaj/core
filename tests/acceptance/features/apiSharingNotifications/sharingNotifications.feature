Feature: Display notifications when receiving a share
	As a user
	I want to see notifications about shares that have been offered to me
	So that I can easily decide what I want to do with new received shares

	Background:
		Given the app "notifications" has been enabled
		And using API version "1"
		And using new DAV path
		And user "user0" has been created
		And user "user1" has been created
		And user "user2" has been created
		And these groups have been created:
			|groupname|
			|grp1     |
		And user "user1" has been added to group "grp1"
		And user "user2" has been added to group "grp1"

	Scenario: share to user sends notification
		Given parameter "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
		When user "user0" shares folder "/PARENT" with user "user1" using the API
		And user "user0" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with user "user1" using the API
		Then user "user1" should have 2 notifications
		And the last notification of user "user1" should match these regular expressions
			| app         | /^files_sharing$/                       |
			| subject     | /^User "user0" shared "PARENT" with you$/ |
			| message     | /^$/                                    |
			| link        | /^%base_url%(\/index\.php)?\/f\/(\d+)$/ |
			| object_type | /^local_share$/                         |
